# grind-75

Welcome to WCRI Fellow Algos!

These are curated by: https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?difficulty=Easy&amp;difficulty=Medium&amp;difficulty=Hard&amp;mode=preferences&amp;weeks=12&amp;hours=6&amp;order=all_rounded

Hello hello! I’ll be posting algos everyday at 10am! Feel free to work on these on your own time throughout the day. 

## Fellows Algo Hour
- I’ll be posting 1~2 algos a day. These are based on [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) and we’ll be starting off “Easy” but working up to some “Hards” in the next 6 weeks! 
- I DO have a github repo setup and will be updating throughout the weeks. Feel free to use that OR use it as a template to set up your own algo repo, OR just use the files I post!
- I highly, highly encourage writing your own tests!! I will try to include some basic tests.

## How To Test
JS: `npm run test-solo [ALGO-FILE-NAME]`
TS: 
1. run `tsc challenges/typescript/[ALGO-FILE-NAME]`
2. `npm run test-solo [ALGO-FILE-NAME] typescript`
